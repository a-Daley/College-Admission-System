"About 45 percent of America’s billionaires and more than half of Forbes’s list of the most powerful people attended schools where incoming freshmen average in the top first percentile of SAT scores." (The Atlantic)

"Dale and Krueger even found that the average SAT scores of all the schools a student applies to is a more powerful predictor of success than the school that student actually attends."

"Among men, the new study found no relationship between college selectivity and long-term earnings. But for women, “attending a school with a 100-point higher average SAT score” increased earnings by 14 percent and reduced marriage by 4 percent." (The Atlantic)

!![Income Equality]
A 2017 study led by the economist Raj Chetty found that lower-income students at an elite school such as Columbia University have a “much higher chance of reaching the [top 1 percent] of the earnings distribution” than those at an excellent public university, such as suny Stony Brook in Long Island.

On average, a student who attends a community college will stay within 300 miles of the college and 61% live within 50 miles of the college.
State university grads generally stay within state lines with an average distance of 330 miles from their alma mater, and 40% are within 50 miles of the university.
Graduates of elite schools flock to the big cities and tend to move nearly 700 miles away from their universities. Nearly 40% are over 500 miles from the university.
Graduates of schools with large (or fully) online offerings live all over the U.S., and over 60% are more than 500 miles away from their university's central location.

Top States for Retention
States are working hard to retain their college talent, but combating brain drain is never easy. Which states have the best graduate retention rates?

Currently, Texas has the strongest retention rate for college graduates. Georgia, Washington, and population giants California and Florida also retain more than 60% of their graduates. New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Wyoming have the lowest retention rates, keeping less than 30% of their college grads.

WHY
"It’s critical—to not only the country’s economic future, but hundreds of millions of individual Americans’ futures—that we learn more about how and why college matters, so that it can help the right people." (The Atlantic)
